  "Engineering Business School is an indigenous business school that operates from Nigeria. It is a pioneering educational program that merges advanced technology education with core business management principles. Established in 2024, the program is designed to equip future technology leaders with the skills needed to navigate the intersection of technology, innovation and business strategy in today's rapidly evolving digital landscape. The program focusses more on business management, analysis and intelligence, entrepreneurship, finance, marketing, leadership development, artificial intelligence, innovation, data management and technology. We believe that technological professionals like engineers who are solutions providers can easily build business empires for economic development.",
  "Because we are focusing more on people from developing countries who cannot easily afford the fee for international university MBA, we will remain non-accredited by government. We believe that skills and knowledge are far better than paper certificates without impact. However, we planned to be accredited by the Nigerian Society of Engineers (NSE) and the Council for the Regulation of Engineering in Nigeria (COREN). We offer TechMBA (General, Executive, and specialized) including other specialized certification courses.",
  "Despite focusing more on developing countries, the school uses qualified and experienced faculty across the globe to deliver its courses. We are targeting university students, fresh graduates and mid-level professionals who are faced with a high unemployment rate in Africa. It is a school where technological skills are turned into business. To move faster and easily accessible, we operate virtually and live stream.",
